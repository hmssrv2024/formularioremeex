You are tasked with refactoring and modernizing an existing HTML/CSS/JavaScript web application for a remittance service. The current codebase is a single-page application with a multi-step registration form, login form, accessibility controls, and a neumorphic design with animations (e.g., wave header, snowball loader). While functional, the code has several errors, accessibility issues, performance bottlenecks, and outdated practices. Your goal is to fix all identified issues, implement modern development practices, and enhance the application’s usability, performance, security, and maintainability.
Below is a detailed list of errors to fix, improvements to implement, and modernization tasks. Follow these instructions carefully, ensuring the application remains visually appealing, user-friendly, and aligned with 2025 web development standards.
Errors to Fix
CSS Custom Property (--a) Issue
Problem: The @property rule for the --a variable in the wave animation has limited browser support (unsupported in older browsers like Edge < 91 or Safari < 15.4), which may break the animation.

Task: Provide a fallback animation (e.g., using background-position or SVG) for browsers that don’t support @property. Ensure the animation degrades gracefully without affecting the user experience.

Hardcoded Image URLs
Problem: The logo image is sourced from an external blogger.com URL, which is unreliable for production due to potential downtime or rate-limiting.

Task: Host all images (e.g., logo, icons) on a dedicated CDN or local server. Use modern image formats like WebP for faster loading and include fallback formats (e.g., PNG) for compatibility.

Accessibility Issues
Problem: Interactive elements (e.g., buttons, toggles, forms) lack ARIA attributes, and some elements may not be keyboard-accessible. Focus states are unclear, and color contrast may not meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

Task:
Add ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-label, aria-checked, role="progressbar") to all interactive elements.

Ensure all elements are keyboard-navigable (e.g., use tabindex and handle Enter/Space key events).

Implement visible focus states (e.g., outline or custom focus styles).

Verify and adjust color contrast ratios to meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements (e.g., use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker).

Form Validation
Problem: The email regex (/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/) is too permissive, and the phone number regex (/^\d{6,12}$/) doesn’t account for country-specific formats. Validation is client-side only.

Task:
Use a robust email regex (e.g., /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/).

Integrate a library like libphonenumber-js for phone number validation, supporting international formats.

Provide real-time validation feedback with debounced input events to avoid performance issues.

Implement server-side validation for all form submissions.

Performance Concerns
Problem: The wave animation (24 .wave-col elements) and snowball loader are resource-intensive, potentially causing lag on low-end devices.

Task:
Simplify the wave animation (e.g., use a single SVG or canvas-based animation).

Optimize the snowball loader by reducing DOM elements and using GPU-accelerated properties (e.g., transform, opacity).

Apply will-change sparingly and test performance on low-end devices (e.g., using Chrome DevTools’ performance tab).

JavaScript Event Listeners
Problem: Event listeners (e.g., mousedown, mouseup, touchstart) are added individually, leading to repetitive and hard-to-maintain code.

Task:
Use event delegation for button interactions (e.g., attach listeners to a parent container).

Debounce or throttle input event listeners (e.g., for validation) to improve performance.

Responsive Design
Problem: Progress bar labels are hidden on mobile without alternatives, reducing usability.

Task: Provide alternative progress indicators for mobile (e.g., tooltips, simplified text, or icons). Test responsiveness across devices (e.g., 320px to 1920px viewports).

Security Concerns
Problem: Client-side-only password validation and no mention of secure data transmission or CSRF protection.

Task:
Ensure all form submissions use HTTPS.

Implement server-side validation for all inputs.

Add CSRF tokens to form submissions.

Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks (e.g., use a library like DOMPurify).

Vendor Prefixes
Problem: Some CSS properties (e.g., -webkit-appearance) lack unprefixed versions, causing issues in non-WebKit browsers.

Task: Use unprefixed properties where supported and integrate a tool like Autoprefixer in the build process to handle vendor prefixes automatically.

Missing Error Handling
Problem: JavaScript assumes DOM elements exist (e.g., loginPasswordToggle) without null checks, risking runtime errors.

Task: Add null checks for all DOM queries (e.g., if (element) { ... }). Implement try-catch blocks for critical operations.

Improvements and Modernizations
To modernize the application, implement the following enhancements to improve performance, maintainability, accessibility, and user experience. Use modern tools and best practices aligned with 2025 web development standards.
Adopt a Frontend Framework
Task: Migrate the application to a modern frontend framework like React, Vue, or Svelte to:
Break the UI into reusable components (e.g., FormStep, NeumorphicButton, ProgressBar).

Manage state efficiently (e.g., form data, step navigation) using framework-specific state management (e.g., React’s useState, Vue’s ref).

Optimize rendering with virtual DOM or Svelte’s compile-time approach.

Example: Create a ProgressBar component that dynamically renders steps and progress based on the current step.

Use CSS-in-JS or CSS Modules
Task: Replace global CSS with CSS-in-JS (e.g., styled-components, Emotion) or CSS Modules to scope styles to components, preventing naming conflicts and improving maintainability.

Example: Style the registration form card using styled-components with dynamic theming support.

Optimize Animations
Task:
Use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) for all animations.

Replace the wave animation with a single SVG or canvas-based animation to reduce DOM overhead.

Use the Web Animations API for JavaScript-controlled animations when needed.

Lazy-load non-critical animations using Intersection Observer.

Example: Implement a simplified wave animation with an SVG and CSS background-position.

Enhance Accessibility
Task:
Add ARIA roles and attributes (e.g., role="progressbar", aria-current="step").

Implement focus management for modals and forms (e.g., trap focus within the form).

Use semantic HTML (<nav>, <main>, <form>).

Ensure all interactive elements have a minimum touch target size of 44x44px (per WCAG).

Example: Add role="progressbar" to the progress bar with aria-valuenow, aria-valuemin, and aria-valuemax.

Improve Form Handling
Task:
Use a form validation library like VeeValidate (Vue) or Formik with Yup (React) for robust client-side validation.

Integrate server-side validation using Fetch or Axios for API calls.

Add input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.

Provide real-time feedback with clear error messages and success states.

Example: Implement a Yup schema for email, password, and phone number validation with real-time feedback.

Add Type Safety with TypeScript
Task: Migrate JavaScript to TypeScript to add static typing, improving code reliability and IDE support.

Example: Define interfaces for form data (e.g., interface FormData { email: string; password: string; }) and type-check all functions.

Optimize Performance
Task:
Lazy-load images using loading="lazy" or Intersection Observer.

Minify CSS and JavaScript using a build tool like Vite or Webpack.

Use a CDN for static assets.

Implement code splitting to load only necessary JavaScript for each page or component.

Example: Add loading="lazy" to the logo image and use a CDN for delivery.

Enhance UI/UX
Task:
Add microinteractions (e.g., subtle animations for form field focus or button hovers).

Implement progressive enhancement to ensure core functionality works without JavaScript.

Add internationalization (i18n) using a library like i18next to support multiple languages.

Extend the high-contrast mode to include a full dark mode with CSS variables.

Example: Create a dark mode toggle that switches CSS variables (e.g., --neutral-bg, --text-color).

Add Testing and CI/CD
Task:
Write unit tests for JavaScript logic using Jest or Vitest.

Write end-to-end tests for form flows using Cypress or Playwright.

Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests, lint code, and deploy automatically.

Example: Write a Jest test for the checkPasswordStrength function.

Improve SEO and Metadata
Task:
Add meta tags for description, keywords, and Open Graph data.

Ensure the site is crawlable by search engines (e.g., avoid JavaScript-only content).

Use server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) if using a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.

Example: Add <meta name="description" content="Secure and fast remittance service"> and Open Graph tags.

Replace Neumorphism with Glassmorphism or Flat Design
Task: Replace the neumorphic design with glassmorphism (translucent backgrounds with blur) or a flat design with vibrant colors for better accessibility and a modern aesthetic.

Example: Style cards with backdrop-filter: blur(10px) and background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1).

Implement PWA Features
Task:
Add a service worker for offline functionality and caching.

Create a manifest.json for installability on mobile devices.

Example: Include a manifest with icons and a theme color matching the brand.

Integrate Analytics
Task: Add Google Analytics or Plausible to track user interactions, form abandonment rates, and page views.

Example: Include the Google Analytics script with event tracking for form submissions.

Use Modern Build Tools
Task: Use Vite or esbuild for faster development and production builds. Configure minification, tree-shaking, and code splitting.

Example: Set up a Vite project with React and TypeScript plugins.

Additional Requirements
Code Quality:
Follow the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle.

Use consistent code formatting with a linter like ESLint and a formatter like Prettier.

Write clear, concise comments and documentation for complex logic.

Browser Compatibility:
Ensure the application works in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome for Android).

Provide fallbacks for unsupported features (e.g., @property, modern APIs).

Performance Goals:
Achieve a Lighthouse score of 90+ for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.

Ensure the first contentful paint (FCP) is under 1.5 seconds on a 4G connection.

Security:
Follow OWASP best practices for web security.

Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent XSS and other attacks.
